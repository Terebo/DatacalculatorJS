# DatacalculatorJS
A little JS blackbox you can use to calculate a data ofset, loops aroiund months and years

# How to use?
calcDate(date, amountAdded)

date = day,month,fullyear

!the commas are important, don't omit them!

day: starts at 1

month: starts at 0

year: starts at 1

amountAdded = integer

integer = the amount of days you want added

feel free to use this everywhere you'd want, there are probally better ones out there. but this works and is simple
